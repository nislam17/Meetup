State of the webpages:
in order to start, run index.php
the login, register, and logout should work just fine
the "create a group" link should work, but currently does not include interests
the "my groups" and "my upcoming events" links should also work
the "create event" page does not work at all yet
there is currently no way of creating interests
the "potential time conflicts" query is bugged

Additional features:

A member will be able to select an event and see if the time conflicts with an event that they plan on going to. (Matthew)
select title,start_time,end_time
from (events e natural join attend)
where username = ? and (event_id,username) not in (
	select event_id,username
	from events natural join attend
	where e.start_time > end_time or e.end_time < start_time or event_id = ?
	)

?: current user's username and the selected event's event_id

A member will be able to see groups that have the same interests as groups he/she is already in (Matthew)
select distinct group_id,group_name
from groups natural join about
where (interest_name) in (
	select interest_name
	from belongs_to natural join about
	where username = ?
    )
    and (group_id) not in (
	select group_id 
	from belongs_to
	where username = ?
	)
both ?'s represent the current user's username

An authorized user can edit the location and time of an event
update events (Matthew)
set lname=?,zip=?,start_time=?,end_time=?
where (group_id) in (
	select group_id
	from belongs_to
	where username = ? and authorized = 1
	)

first set of ?'s represent the new values for the respective field
the last ? represents the current user's username

A member can find events based on their own location (Nazifa)
select event_id 
from events 
where zip = ? 

?: member's zipcode  

A member can search up existing interests that don't belong in a group yet (Nazifa) 
select interest_name 
from interest right outer join about 
where group_id = NULL 

An authorized user can delete an existing group (Nazifa) 
delete from events 
where (group_id) in (
      select group_id
      from belongs_to
      where username = ? and authorized = 1 
      )
