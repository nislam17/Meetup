State of the webpages:
in order to start, run index.php
the login, register, and logout should work just fine
the "create a group" link should work, but currently does not include interests
the "my groups" and "my upcoming events" links should also work
there is currently no way of creating interests

Additional features:

A member will be able to select an event and see if the time conflicts with an event that they plan on going to. (Matthew)
select event_id,title,start_time,end_time
from (events e natural join attend)
where username = ? and (event_id,username) not in (
	select event_id,username
	from events natural join attend
	where ? > end_time or ? < start_time or event_id = ?
	)

?: current user's username, selected event's start_time, selected event's end_time, and the selected event's event_id

A member will be able to see groups that have the same interests as the group page he/she is on, excluding groups the user is already in (Matthew)
select distinct group_id,group_name 
from groups natural join about
where ((interest_name) in 
	(select interest_name from groups natural join about where group_id = ?))
	and ((group_id) not in
	(select group_id from belongs_to where username = ? or group_id = ?))
	order by group_name
?: current user's username, and the group_id of the group he/she is viewing, respectively

An authorized user can edit an event (Matthew)
update events 
set title=?,description=?,start_time=?,end_time=?,lname=?,zip=? 
where event_id = ?

first set of ?'s represent the new values for the respective field
the last ? represents the event's event_id
NOTE: Application code guarantees that the user is authorized in the event's group

A member can find events based on their own location (Nazifa)
select event_id, title 
from events 
where zip = (select zipcode from member where username=?) and event_id not in 
	(select event_id from attend where username = ?)

both ?'s are the username values 

A member can search up existing interests that don't belong in a group yet (Nazifa) 
select interest_name 
from interest 
where interest_name not in 
	(select interest_name 
	from about)

An authorized user can delete an existing group (Nazifa) 
delete from attend where event_id=? 
delete from events where event_id=? 

both ?'s are the event_id's
