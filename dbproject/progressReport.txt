State of the webpages:
in order to start, run index.php
the login, register, and logout should work just fine, but register currently does not save the zip to the database
the "create a group" link should work, but currently does not include interests
the "my groups" link should also work, but group_pages are not formatted yet
the "my upcoming events" page does not work at all yet
there is currently no way of creating events or interests

Additional features:

A member will be able to select an event and see if the time conflicts with an event that they plan on going to.
select title,start_time,end_time
from (events natural join attend) e
where username = ? and (event_id,username) not in (
	select event_id,username
	from events natural join attend
	where e.start_time > end_time or e.end_time < start_time
	)

?: current user's username

A member will be able to see groups that have the same interests as groups he/she is already in
select distinct group_id,group_name
from groups natural join about
where (interest_name) in (
	select interest_name
	from belongs_to natural join about
	where username = ?
    )
    and (group_id) not in (
	select group_id 
	from belongs_to
	where username = ?
	)
both ?'s represent the current user's username

An authorized user can edit the location and time of an event
update events 
set lname=?,zip=?,start_time=?,end_time=?
where (group_id) in (
	select group_id
	from belongs_to
	where username = ? and authorized = 1
	)

first set of ?'s represent the new values for the respective field
the last ? represents the current user's username

select event_id,title,description,start_time,end_time,group_name
from (attend a join events using (event_id)) join groups using (group_id)
where a.username = ?
